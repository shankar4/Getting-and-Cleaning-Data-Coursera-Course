How the script works: For more details and details on 'due diligence' (that is, understanding 
the data before embarking on an analysis) see the other .md file 
The script has been described by taking the example of 4 data sets for 'test' and 'train'. 
They are included in the demo example folder. This folder has the test and train data folder, 
a detailed WORD document on the script steps and results, and a resulting .txt file that is
saved back to the working directory.
