Project Assignment for the course: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set
How the script works: For more details and details on 'due diligence' (that is, understanding 
the data before embarking on an analysis) see the "Assignment Overview.md" file 

A demo example folder, entitled 'Demo Example' has been included. The R script used has been described here
by taking the example of 4 data sets for 'test' and 'train' from the original data set. 
This folder has the test and train data folders,  a detailed WORD document on the script steps and results, 
and a resulting .txt file that is saved back to the working directory.
