Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Coursera-Course
=========================================

This is the Project Assignment for the course. It uses the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set.
How the script works: For more details and details on 'due diligence' (that is, understanding 
the data before embarking on an analysis) see the "Assignment Overview.md" file 

A demo example folder, entitled 'DemoExample' has been included. The R script used has been described here
by taking the example of 4 data sets for 'test' and 'train' from the original data set. 
This folder has the test and train data folders,  a detailed WORD document on the script steps and results, 
and a resulting .txt file (myavg.txt) that is saved back to the working directory. 

The process outlined in the 'DemoExample' was used for the whole set. All the correspoding files are included in this directory: (1) run_analysis.R file - no comments are included here - the demoexample's WORD document has all the details given there; (2) run_analysis_R_console_output - this is a WORD document that fully documents the console output, which but for comments is pretty self-documenting; (3) tidydata.txt - the outputs of the R script. It is a text file of the data base with 180 rows and 20 columns; and (4) codebook.md - this details the codes and provides more details on the text file.
